CHANCES OF ERRORS
json chunk loading:77 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getBoundingClientRect')
you forgot this line <div class="chart-container"></div> 
OR use only above line in html page, remove all other codes
ERROR Error: no root : 
you have to pass array in .data(data)
main.ts:21 ERROR TypeError: linkUpdate.transition is not a function
"d3-selection": "3", use this package and version is 3 for angular 12.2.16
Or maybe some other library’s dependencies make conflict with d3-org’s dependent libraries ( in buildesk crm there is @swimlane/ngx-chart which make d3-selection dependency issue with d3-org-chart)

NOTES
while using d3-org-chart is depend on d3-selection, and another library swimlane/ngx-chart also depend on d3-selection, but both need diff version of d3-selection, so install version 3 of d3-selection, so d3-org working but swimlane is stopped working, so find d3-selection version which are compatible with both library, by checking package.lock.json, and finally upgrade swimlane and now both working
if you want to show how many children inside node then you have to use latest version of ng-org-chart for may 2024 it’s 3.1.1
